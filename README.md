# bankableChallenge

This project is a practice to simulate an online app, where the user can login using his google account and access to the company account. It represents an online service for finance, with the focus on this practice on the feature of uploading invoices to his account. The project was made to have a webpage app look, simulating fake news and possible menus that are not working.

INSTALLATION

This project is available in Github pages for an easiest use: 

Can be cloned to your local machine, if you choose this option, you just need to follow the steps:

1- Clone the repository
2- Run "npm run dev"
3- Access the local url http://localhost:5173/ to open the project

USAGE

The project is using Google gis api to login, and the app is in test mode, so not any google account can access. Use the next account for test use:

invoiceme.test@gmail.com
invoicemeTEST

Once inside, remember that only the feature "Upload invoice" is really working. It is possible to access it using the navbar menu or clicking a card in the homepage.

The project is not pretending to use a server side, so the "upload" action is faked in the project.

You can find a pdf inside the project that you can use to attach to the invoice form or you can use another, it is not uploaded anywhere.

UI/UX

The project was designed to have a login view in the style of the backend accesses of well-known CMSs, and then present the user with a web-style environment, with a menu of available tools.

In the case of the invoice form, it was intended to be presented in a space with a lot of air and in a step by step format, to guide the user with a simple use and making use of clear messages on how to proceed.

We also wanted to create the feeling of an application by having the user's section in the top bar, where they could access their profile, log out...
